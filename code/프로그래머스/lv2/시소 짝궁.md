> if y in `weights`, it is 시소 짝궁

## 코드

```python
from collections import Counter


def solution(weights):
    counter = Counter(weights)
    answer = 0
    for w in weights:
        for x, y in ((2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)):
            if (w * x) % y == 0:
                p = (w * x) // y
                if (x, y) == (2, 2):
                    answer += counter[p] - 1
                else:
                    answer += counter[p]

    return answer // 2
